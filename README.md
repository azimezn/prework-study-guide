# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Organizing notes in a single place makes it easier to study and to find information you need in the future. It is easier to use than flipping through pages in a notebook, which doesn't have the option to use ctrl+F.

## Usage

Each section of the page contains notes about certain topics such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. You can open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
